        <p>&ldquo;It has been 614 days since I last saw my daughter outside prison walls,&rdquo; Zing Nun Mawi Bawm said
          on December 12th 2025, her eyes welling with tears. &ldquo;The prison ruined her future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On April 4th 2024, nineteen-year-old Tina Lal Ruat Fel Bawm returned from the capital to her hometown in
          Bandarban, Chattogram, during a school break. She was a student at St. Joseph High School and College in
          Savar, Dhaka. Her homecoming was short-lived.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Just four days after her arrival, her neighbourhood of <a
            href="https://earth.google.com/web/search/bethel+para,+bandarban/@22.0482935,92.409616,49.69557145a,776.55152828d,35y,323.96239021h,60t,0r/data=CoUBGlcSUQolMHgzMGFkNjM5OGYzZmNhZDlmOjB4ZmZhYzQ0ZWI1NTdlODVkMBkAHHv2XAw2QCHG-gYmNxpXQCoWYmV0aGVsIHBhcmEsIGJhbmRhcmJhbhgCIAEiJgokCWg-G4H2DDZAEVFU-GjDCzZAGZDLOVeOGldAIfop1PTfGVdAQgIIAToDCgEwQgIIAEoNCP___________wEQAA">Bethel
            Para</a> in Bandarban was swept by a joint forces operation led by the army. The other units were the Rapid
          Action Battalion (RAB), Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), and the police.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;She had come home for the holidays. Who could have imagined that this visit would shatter our
          lives?,&rdquo; Zing Nun Mawi lamented. Tina was taken into custody alongside dozens of her neighbours. That
          day, a total of 49 people, including 18 women, were detained from Bethel Para. For Tina, she was uprooted from
          her home during a school holiday and cast into an overcrowded prison cell. Her freedom had come to an abrupt,
          indefinite end.</p>

        <p>This was not an isolated incident rather a window into a wider crisis of displacement and fear gripping the
          Bawm community. Beyond the prison walls, the army&rsquo;s campaign has resulted in <a
            href="https://netra.news/2025/bangladesh-army-indigenous-bawm/">extrajudicial killings</a>
          and a migratory shift that threatens the very survival of the 11,000-member Bawm community.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>More than one-third of the population has now fled to refugee camps in neighboring India, according to the
          Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission and International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA). They were
          driven by a combination of insurgent violence and a state-led lockdown of ancestral villages. For those who
          remain, daily life is governed by a strict army permit system, where even the sale of vegetables, movement
          between neighborhoods or medical appointments require written authorization from army commanders.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>An eyewitness account</h2>

        <p>&ldquo;It was 5:00 am. An order was coming through a megaphone. It was from the army: We need to leave our
          homes and gather at a single point,&rdquo; Lal Mun San Bawm, a resident of the village, recalled the fateful
          April 8th. Lal Mun is the <em>karbari</em> of&nbsp; Bethel Para &mdash; a village chieftain.</p>

        <p>Lal Mun added, &ldquo;A line formed. It was an assembly of men, women, teenage girls, and youth. The small
          children tightly held their parents&rsquo; hands, while the infants remained in their mothers&rsquo;
          arms.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Tina, arrested on April 8th, is just one of eight Bawm women currently in custody. For a
          staggering one year and nine months, these indigenous women have been detained without trial. This crackdown
          came on the heels of the robbery of two banks and hostage-taking of a bank manager by the armed group
          Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) on April 4th 2024.</p>

        <p>Lal Mun further said, &ldquo;The army officers scanned our faces, eventually singling out the younger men and
          women from the crowd. One by one, those chosen were ordered to get into the police vans and taken toward
          Bandarban Sadar.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Lal Mun&rsquo;s account is not uncommon. Through a comprehensive analysis of army statements, legal filings,
          police reports, and first-hand testimony from victims&rsquo; families and eyewitnesses, Netra News has
          uncovered a pattern of systemic raids and mass arrests targeting Bawm neighbourhoods in Bandarban. Often
          conducted under the cover of darkness or in the early hours of the day, these joint forces operations led by
          the army have become commonplace in the region.</p>

        <h2>The faces behind the bars</h2>

        <p>Netra News identified the eight indigenous women behind the prison walls: Tina Lal
          Ruat fel Bawm, Jesy Zingjinho Par Bawm, Lal Tlanh Kim Bawm, Partha Zual Bawm, Melory Bawm, Akim Bawm, Lal
          Ring To Loyang Bawm and Nem Pem Bawm. Each name represents a life derailed.</p>

        <p>The academic journeys of nineteen-year-old students Tina and Partha, twenty-year-old Jesy, and
          twenty-two-year-old Lal Rin have stalled at the hands of state action based on suspicion sans evidence.</p>

        <p>Lal Tlanh, a 30 year-old NGO worker awaiting the final results of her BSS degree, now stands accused of being
          a criminal. The lives of Akim and Nem Pem have similarly been interrupted by arbitrary detention. The absence
          of 26 year-old Melory, who is the primary caregiver of her family, is keenly felt. Her dependents have been
          plunged into a daily struggle for survival.</p>

        <p>After being taken from their home, the women were processed at Ruma Thana before being transferred to

          weapon looting incidents. Later bail applications were denied in court, and they were placed in custody for

          been released except eight. &nbsp;</p>

        <h2>The legal battleground</h2>

        <p>The detainees face charges under a combination of the Special Powers Act, the Arms Act, the Anti-Terrorism
          Act, and the Penal Code. However, they have no prior criminal history or documented involvement in activities
          outlawed by these pieces of legislation.</p>

        <p>The detention of eight Bawm women for over a year and a half without trial has sparked concerns regarding
          potential human rights violations. This assertion comes from their lawyer Abdullah Al Noman. The Supreme Court
          advocate revealed difficulties in securing a hearing for the bail petitions, &ldquo;So far, we have sought to
          hold the hearing of their bail petitions at three different High Court benches. The cases were returned with
          the remark, &lsquo;We will not grant bail in Kuki-Chin cases, go to another court.&rsquo; This kind of
          behaviour is leading to grievous human rights violations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Sitting in his chambers, Noman further said, &ldquo;This is a form of collective punishment against the Bawm
          people.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Human rights defenders contend that the reported detentions are not isolated incidents, but evidence of a
          long-lasting, systemic discrimination by the state against its indigenous minority population. Saydia Gulrukh,
          an anthropologist and human rights activist, emphasised, &ldquo;The legal system is unequal toward indigenous
          communities. When they are sick, they are entitled to receive treatment, yet three of them died in custody. We
          still do not know whether any investigation, as required under the jail code, was conducted to identify the
          real cause of death.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>The exodus</h2>

        <p>While Tina languishes in a prison cell, others have been forced to choose between the risk of detention and
          the perils of being cast into the wilderness. &ldquo;In my country, I had a home. I had my cattle. Here, I
          have nothing,&rdquo; said a despondent Laltoyar Bawm. The former resident of Thingdolte Tlang Para in
          Bandarban is currently seeking refuge at the <a

            camp</a> in Mizoram. Laltoyar fled his home in November 2022, seeking safety for his wife and
          son, when conflict erupted between the KNF &mdash; a separatist organisation advocating for the autonomy of
          the Kuki-Chin people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts &mdash; and the Bangladesh Army.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A Netra News reporter visited Parva-III earlier this year, and interviewed Laltoyar Bawm on April 1st,
          &ldquo;There are 41 families in this camp, including my own. We are provided two meals a day, but only upon
          presenting our refugee cards. I long to return to my country, but I cannot find the courage. I am caught
          between the KNF on one side and army operations on the other.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Driven by fear of conflict, army crackdowns, and violence, he is among the one-third of the Christian
          minority Bawm community &mdash; whose total population is a mere 11,000 &mdash; who have been forced to
          migrate, to save their lives. They have taken shelter as refugees in camps in Mizoram, India.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The journey from Thingdolte Tlang Para, Bangladesh to Parva-III, Mizoram, India was a trial of endurance for
          Laltoyar Bawm and his family. They navigated a perilous migration route through the region&rsquo;s most rugged
          and remote swathes of land.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>As members of the Bawm clan, these refugees from Bangladesh are ethnic Mizos, bound to their counterparts
          across the border by a shared history and ancient kinship.</p>

        <p>The exodus of the Bawm community began in November 2022, when refugees first arrived at
          Chamdur &lsquo;P&rsquo; village in the Lawngtlai district. Over the following two years, residents from
          Kersetlang, Pankhiang, and other Bawm villages in Bandarban fled their homes to seek shelter in Mizoram
          villages like Hruitezawl and <a

          These families wanted to survive the escalating conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. According to
          the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA), more than 4,000 members of the
          Bawm community were displaced from their ancestral lands following the joint forces crackdown against the
          KNF.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>No permission, no movement</h2>

        <p>To retrieve basic necessities like rice, oil, and vegetables, Bawm residents in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
          must first secure a written permit from the commander of the nearest army camp. This control
          is absolute. The right to earn a living is also curtailed, with villagers requiring the same permission simply
          to sell their products at the nearby market.</p>

        <p>According to the Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission, at least six Bawm
          villages &mdash; Bethel Para, Pankhyang Para, Suanlu Para, Faruk Para, Eden Para, and
          Darjeeling Para &mdash; have been locked down under a sweeping army crackdown across Ruma,
          Bandarban, and Rowangchari. Apart from this, through an&nbsp; investigation by Netra News uncovered cases in

        <p>Street art is bringing the Bawm detention crisis to the forefront, reclaiming the narrative
          for those detained. Graffiti of slogans &mdash; &ldquo;Bawm Lives Matter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Free Bawm
          People&rdquo; and more &mdash; have appeared throughout the three Hill districts and Dhaka as part of a
          growing protest movement. On May 15th of this year, echoes of these slogans reverberated in Dhaka as people
          from various walks of life gathered to demand the release of the detained Bawm individuals.
        </p>

        <p>The ongoing crisis has drawn concern from international human rights organisations. On December 12th 2025,
          Amnesty International did more than just send a letter to Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus; they
          declared an Urgent Action, signalling a profound alarm over the situation.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Amplifying this crisis, Chris Chapman, Amnesty International's adviser on indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights,
          demanded an end to what he calls the indiscriminate targeting of the Bawm community, &ldquo;Every Bawm
          detainee must be immediately released unless authorities can produce sufficient, admissible evidence of their
          criminal involvement.&rdquo; Until then, he underscored the moral necessity of ensuring both competent legal
          counsel and essential healthcare for the detainees.</p>

        <p>As of June 2025, 328 individuals from 121 Bawm families have returned to their ancestral homes in Bandarban.
          The group consists of 172 men, 116 women, and 40 children. Despite their return, the community continues to
          live precariously, the persistent threat of the KNF and army operations casting a pall of fear over it. Many
          are still in refugee camps in Mizoram too. Bawm villages in Bandarban, sparser than they used to be, are
          awaiting the return of their residents. The ongoing situation has trapped them in this brutal reality of a
          perennial, fearful waiting.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Once a hopeful teenager, cheerfully returning home to spend time with the family during her holiday, Tina
          Bawm faces the prospect of spending her second Christmas behind bars. Her books are now gathering dust; so is
          her mother&rsquo;s hope.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Her mother said, &ldquo;It seems her only crime is the name she carries: Bawm. ●</p>
